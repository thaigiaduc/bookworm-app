                        One of the last travel bookstores in the country, our Manhattan store carries a range of 
                        guidebooks (all 10% off) to suit the needs and tastes of every traveller and budget.

                        We believe that a novel or travelogue can be just as valuable a key to a place as any guidebook, 
                        and our well-read, well-travelled staff is happy to make reading recommendations for any 
                        traveller, book lover, or gift giver.
